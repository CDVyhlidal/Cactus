- `[1.08-1.14d]` Battle.net-only Runewords are now enabled on Single Player.

## Extras

- GlideWrapper

## Notes

- The Game Menus CPU fix will only be applied for v1.10+. The fix for versions
  pre 1.10 was reverted since it caused lag for systems that weren't using the
  GlideWrapper. Most people don't spend a lot of time in the Main Menu anyways
  so it isn't a big deal to keep this in.

- If you are using Glide, make sure to disable VSYNC in your Glide settings
  or you will still experience high CPU usage in LAN games.

- Due to a Windows bug, the Minimize/Close buttons will not show if you are using Glide.

### Patch 1.05b

This patch was picked over 1.06 since 1.06 contains anti-duping code
that would delete items in earlier versions that were found legit but
that the game assigned identical fingerprints to.

### Patch 1.09b

This patch was picked over 1.09d because it contains 'players 64' and
also working CtC. 1.09d has broken CtC which means that you will
see the animation of your CtC effect, but it actually won't do anything.

### Patch 1.10f+

- 1.10f has been kept since it is the version of Diablo II with the most mod support.
- 1.13d has been kept since it is the last version of Diablo II before the major rearchitect
  that Blizzard made.
- 1.14d is kept since it is the latest version of the game.
