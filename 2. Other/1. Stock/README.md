The following files are the Original DLLs and Patch_D2.mpq for
the specific versions that Singling touches. If you use these,
my Singling changes will be un-applied. The original Game.exe
(Which will remove the CD fix if used) is not included.

Also, the **`Original Files`** for Patch **`1.07.41`** are the ones
provided by **`GalaXyHaXz`** after he fixed it. This patch was
originally unplayable on Single Player/LAN, and thus it required
extensive changes to be playable again. So reverting these files
will simply un-apply my own changes to them.
