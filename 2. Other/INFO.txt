Diablo II Classic + Lord of Destruction : No CD Pack
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
This pack contains a modified "Game.exe" for every patch, pre-1.12. They
have been decrypted and SecuRom has been removed. This will allow older
versions of the game to run without the CD. The files included should be
identical to the way they were before being protected by SecuRom. Feel
free to use them for playing or modifying older patches. They may be ran
in a debugger.

Simply copy the "Game.exe" file from the desired version in the "Platforms"
directory into the "Diablo II" directory. There isn't any need to backup the
old file as patches still work.

Note that there isn't a version included for 1.04 and 1.09c. These patches
were only available for a very short time and neither can be downloaded.

I've deleted some versions that are no longer needed for the BCC,
any versions 1.08+ for Classic have been removed, and the "Battle.net"
beta files for 1.02 and 1.07.41 have been removed as well since I don't
have the 1.02 Battle.net base files and 1.07.41 already has this included.
Overall regardless, the Battle.net beta files aren't that important anyways,
in the grand scheme of things. GalaXyHaXz's description has been modified
to reflect this restructuring.
