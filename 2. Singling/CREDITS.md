- Credits to PhrozenKeep for having a wonderful community filled with knowledge
  and resources. Without them none of this would be possible.

- Myhrginoc at the PhrozenKeep for the Allow Hardcore stuff. It allowed me to locate all of
  the other hardcore code for the rest of the versions much quicker!

- FrozenKeep & Nefarius for the 1.00 - 1.06 Multi Instance DLL.

- Credits to Lemma for providing the 1.14d Multi-Instance .exe Offset

- Credit to GalaXyHaXz for:
  - unpacking all of the pre-1.12 exes so that we don't need to use
  - helping me understand the CPU fix for the pre 1.10 Main Menu.
  - contributing the "adding minimize and close buttons" code
  - contributing key code and explanations for having 1 d2gfx.dll and allowing
    full screen and window mode to work together while window mode doesn't minimize
    when you click out of it.

- Necrolis and others at PhrozenKeep for posting the D2Gfx Ordinals for 1.10. This allowed me to at   least have a starting place to look at when debugging for an anti-minimization window fix.
