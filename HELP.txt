BVS Structure
---------------
The directory structure that BVS uses is as follows:

Diablo II/                        - (Your Diablo II directory)

Diablo II/Classic                 - All your classic versions will be in here
Diablo II/Classic/<label>         - Location of your Diablo II files for this version.
Diablo II/Classic/<label>/data    - Data folder (If you have one)
Diablo II/Classic/<label>/save    - Location of your save file for this specific version of classic

The same applies for expansion:

Diablo II/Expansion
Diablo II/Expansion/<label>
Diablo II/Expansion/<label>/data
Diablo II/Expansion/<label>/save

Moving Existing Characters and DLLs to new locations:
---------------
If you have any existing characters, just take the characters from your specific version's save folder and put it into
its new location (Example, if you already had some 1.07 expansion characters, you can place them in: C:\Program Files\Diablo II\Expansion\1.07\save).

Path A) If you are using any custom .dlls (Like d2gfx.dll), you can place this dll in its respective folder (Example: ..\Expansion\1.07 folder *before switching to that version*).

Path B) If you already switched into that version, you can drop the dll into the Diablo II folder and also the respective version folder (or switch to a different
version and switch back into the version you want after you followed Path A.

"data" folder
---------------
BVS can run from any location on disk. However, the "-direct -txt" command seems to require that the data folder be in the Diablo II directory.
For this reason, if you are planning on using a data folder, place BVS inside the Diablo II directory as well.

Adding versions afterwards:
---------------
If you want to add any other versions, you can just click "Copy" to make a clone of an existing entry,
and quickly switch the "Version", "Flags" and "Expansion" options. The "Path" can stay the same.

You can also click "Add" and do it from scratch as well, but using the "Copy" option is just a way to save time.

Blizzard released a new patch but it isn't in the Bliss Complete Collection
----------------
Simply run the LOD updater either from the Standalone updater or from Battle.net,
close D2 (if using the latter), select the entry that was last ran and uncheck the "Last Ran"
checkbox, then add a new entry with the new version.

Running BVS after this should work flawlessly and it should automatically backup the new version
files as well.

Troubleshooting
================

"I click Launch but nothing is happening"
----------------
This can happen for multiple reasons. One of them is that the files in your D2 root folder are not correct.
BVS will copy the files from the corresponding "[Classic/Expansion] / <label>" folder into your D2 root folder
before launching if needed. If the files in your back up dirs are incorrect, then this may cause an issue.

The game may not be launching because you have UAC enabled on Windows and you ran BVS directly. Java applications
don't have admin privileges by default. Thus if you have UAC enabled, I recommend you run BVS through the BVS/UAC
script (bat file).

Lastly the game may not be launch because you installed Diablo II through Blizzard's new 1.12 installer and you
are trying to play a version of Diablo II older than 1.12. The reason this problem exists is because starting with
the 1.12 installer, Blizzard updated the MPQ file format that Diablo II uses. Due to this, only versions of Diablo II
that understand this format can be played using the Blizzard installer (1.12+). If you try to use 1.11, 1.10, etc,
those versions only understand the old MPQ file format that Blizzard used between versions 1.00 - 1.11. In order to fix
this, you will need to get ahold of the old MPQ files in some way, primarily by purchasing a pair of old Diablo II 1.00,
1.03, or 1.07 CDs (Or ISOs). You can try eBay or another location to purchase them.

"Oh My... I broke it"
----------------
If you screw up the install and your Diablo II directory files get messed up, just relax.. you don't need to reinstall.
Just extract the files from the Bundle for the version you want and drop them into your
Diablo II folder (Replacing the existing files in there). You already have the MPQ files, so simply replacing
the dlls should do the trick, and re-running that version in BVS should fix it.

Multiple Versions
---------------
If you want to run multiple versions of Diablo II, It is the same process as before. You can get this feature by downloading Singling.
It contains the changes needed in order to allow multiple D2 windows to be launched.
