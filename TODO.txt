Higher Priority
--------------
- Make application only allow one instance.
- Display dialog boxes for important messages.
	> Is label is empty, we won't add or modify the entry, but
	  should we let the window continue to close and still display the message?
	
Lower Priority
--------------
- Allow double click to launch
- Make more checks when switching files/mpq etc so that it doesn't
  throw an exception if the file doesn't exist.
- Make sure window stays on top after I finish editing an entry.
- Should edit window use individual properties that are extracted from selected entry?
  That way we could do more sanity checks on the data before the actual underlying
  object gets modified.
- Should data directory be automatically backed up after all instances of d2 are finished?
- All message boxes should be displayed with "Cactus" as title.
  Make a common messagebox function for this.

Document:
- The Diablo II root directory is considered a replaceable directory. Which means that
  the direction of file copies are coming in one direction, from the storage directory,
  into the root directory. Thus, if you want to update any files in the root directory
  (/data folder, .dlls, etc), Make sure to do this in the storage directory and not
  the root. The file switching/replacement only happens when you switch between entries
  that have different labels.

- You cannot edit an entry that is currently being ran. Only entries that are not currently
  running can be renamed.
