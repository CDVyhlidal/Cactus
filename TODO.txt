- Make more checks when switching files/mpq etc so that it doesn't
  throw an exception if the file doesn't exist.
- Make a "Debug" window where people can see all of the logged messages without
  having to open the application through the command line.
- Make application only allow one instance.
- Display dialog boxes for important messages.
- Make sure window stays on top after I finish editing an entry.
- Is label is empty, we won't add or modify the entry, but
  should we let the window continue to close and still display the message?
- Should edit window use individual properties that are extracted from selected entry?
  That way we could do more sanity checks on the data before the actual underlying
  object gets modified.
  
UI Selection Changes
- Restore selected entry after we click add and then cancel
- Automatically select added entry
- Automatically select the first entry after we delete an entry if available.
- Automatically select last ran entry on app launch.

- Long Term:
  Go through all of the code and add wrappers around any IO or
  other operations so that the code can be unit tested.
- Edit/Add window shouldnt have close event on code behind since
  the app is suppose to be fully MVVM.
  
- Allow double click to launch

Tests
----
- Test situation where a user has an entry that was last ran but then they delete
  it and then run another entry. How does the file replacement, registry update,
  actually work... should be ok though, but double check.

Document:
- The Diablo II root directory is considered a replaceable directory. Which means that
  the direction of file copies are coming in one direction, from the storage directory,
  into the root directory. Thus, if you want to update any files in the root directory
  (/data folder, .dlls, etc), Make sure to do this in the storage directory and not
  the root. The file switching/replacement only happens when you switch between entries
  that have different labels.

- You cannot edit an entry that is currently being ran. Only entries that are not currently
  running can be renamed.
