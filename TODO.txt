- Make more checks when switching files/mpq etc so that it doesn't
  throw an exception if the file doesn't exist.
- Make all of the windows for Add/Edit/About
- Make a "Debug" window where people can see all of the logged messages without
  having to open the application through the command line.
- Make application only allow one instance.
- Check vertical and horizontal window expansions when there
  are too many entries or the strings in label/flags are too long.
- Display dialog boxes for important messages.
- Should I still expose "Last Ran" option?
- Should I still keep a separation between classic and expansion versions?
- Make sure window stays on top after I finish editing an entry.

- Long Term:
  Go through all of the code and add wrappers around any IO or
  other operations so that the code can be unit tested.
- Edit/Add window shouldnt have close event on code behind since
  the app is suppose to be fully MVVM.

Document:
- The Diablo II root directory is considered a replaceable directory. Which means that
  the direction of file copies are coming in one direction, from the storage directory,
  into the root directory. Thus, if you want to update any files in the root directory
  (/data folder, .dlls, etc), Make sure to do this in the storage directory and not
  the root. The file switching/replacement only happens when you switch between entries
  that have different labels.

- You cannot edit an entry that is currently being ran. Only entries that are not currently
  running can be renamed.
