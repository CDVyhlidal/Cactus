- Make more checks when switching files/mpq etc so that it doesn't
  throw an exception if the file doesn't exist.
- Update dependency property so that when we switch versions the UI also gets updated.
- Make all of the windows for Add/Edit/About
- Make a "Debug" window where people can see all of the logged messages without
  having to open the application through the command line.
- Test out that /data/ folder is removed and copied correctly.
- Add checks to make sure that another D2 version cannot be switched to
  if it's not just a flag difference.
- Make application only allow one instance.

- Long Term:
  Go through all of the code and add wrappers around any IO or
  other operations so that the code can be unit tested.
